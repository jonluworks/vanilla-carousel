This is a carousel that was written with stylus and vanilla javascript.

## Event bubbling
Avoids attaching click handlers to many DOM elements by taking advantage of event bubbling and checking event.target.

## BEM naming convention
I followed BEM naming conventions to practice. BEM website is:http://getbem.com/

## Carousel navigation
It features left/right arrow navigation, navigation through progress bubbles, and also auto rotates images every few seconds.
